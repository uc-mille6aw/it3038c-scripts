# Andrew Miller's Project 3 Script

## About the script

<p>This script is a little text based adventure game that I wrote in Python. While Python is not something I have had much expereince with in the past, I wanted to try something new and get out of my comfort zone a little. </p>




## Running the File

### Windows:
<p>Save the script to the top level in your c drive. In powershell, run the script via python: </p>

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\current_user> cd C:\
PS C:\> python project3.py
```
<p>If you can't get the python command to work, try using 'python3' or 'py' instead of 'python'. If you are still having trouble, make sure you have python installed.</p>
<p>If you continue to have trouble and you know python is installed, try following this guide on changing the system environment variable that triggers python in PowerShell: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-up-command-prompt-for-python-in-windows10/ </p>

### Linux:
<p>Save the file to your home directory and then run the file in the terminal: </p>

```console
root:~$ python3 project3.py
```
<p>Note: Make sure python is installed on your system before trying to run the file.</p>


## Inspiration

<p>I got the idea for making this script from this blog post over at the coding pie: https://thecodingpie.com/post/make-your-own-text-based-adventure-game-in-python3 </p> 
<p>I took some ideas from them on how to make some of the basics of the script and built everything from there. All of the story elements and the the code is my own work, but I wanted to be honest about where this idea came from.</p>
